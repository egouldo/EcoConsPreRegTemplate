# Pregistration Template for Ecology and Conservation Modelling

This is a public repository of the preregistration template for modelling in ecology and conservation decision-making (currently in development), by Gould et al. (in prep, 2020). You can find the template development repository [here](https://github.com/egouldo/EcoConsPreReg)

### How to use it?

- The preregistration is to be used for a single study.
- Please respond to each item.
- After all the items have been answered, you can generate a preregistration report for your study by pressing the button labeled GENERATE REPORT at the bottom of the page. 
- Save your transparency report on your computer. Note that after you download your report, your responses will not be saved by the shiny app.
- Upload your transparency report to a public preregistration repository, such as the OSF <INSERT LINK>.
